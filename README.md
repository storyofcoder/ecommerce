<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://devecom.netlify.app/)

E Com is an online store featuring best of brands, trends & styles for men, women, kids & home outlet. With "E Com" we intend to provide easy navigation and checkout options. With this project we also want to encourage visitors to explore the length and breadth of the products offered and to understand how these metrics add to the KPIs of the application and store as a whole. The gathered metrics will be checked for contribution in revenue generation. 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others on React and Express
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Ecommerce from scratch
* You can use this repo for learning purpose.

Easy returns & more. Shop Now! Size Finder. Latest Trends. Online Payment and COD available. 3000+ Brands.
